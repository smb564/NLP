# NLP Algorithms
A collection of basic NLP algorithms implemented by myself. Datasets used are CoNLL-2003 and Penn Tree Bank dataset.
<ul>
<li>Conditional Random Field (Linear Chain CRF) </li>
<li>CKY Algorithm for Context Free Grammer to find the most probable parse </li>
<li>Forward Backward Algorithm; For soft inference and to perform Baum-Welch training </li>
<li>Inside Outside Algorithm; Unsupervised training using EM algorithm for CFGs </li>
<ul>
